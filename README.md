with direct application to the financial services space.")

sFrEd= ("As for my formal education, I hold a degree in a double major within finance, namely Finance and Accounting. Following my decision to move into 
a more technical area of expertise when I joined the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, I built up a good  understanding of where finance and the latest 
technological breakthroughs merge. Throughout my continuous learning I focus on learning both the technical concepts of modelling as well as how to 
interpret the results and thereby be able to participate in the process of everyday decision making within financial firms.")

side projects in Machine Learning. I am open to any kind of collaboration, recommendation on my projects that will enable me to further learn and progress.")
